WTF#
====

This is an experimental program that builds and runs F# projects from FSharp interactive.  It supports iterative 
development via an integrated file watcher and is intended to provided an alternative to the typical IDE-driven 
edit-> build-> run cycle.  Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch">grunt watch</a>.

I will add more details on how to use it "soon".  For now, adventurous people can check out the Nancy Web server 
sample.
